                I have been very fortunate to have been on two co-ops where each has allowed me to learn
                and grow my skills professionally. They were both very different, however, without the first
                I would not have been able to find the second, so it all works out in the end. This is to say
                that sometimes it can be very difficult to secure one. However, there are options. I found my 
                co-op outside of NUWorks, and it worked out. I found that there was actually less competition, 
                which might have helped as well. Plus now that I guess there is a limit to how many applications
                you can send, this is a good resource. In the end, I had over 150 applications my first time, with only 
                two interviews! Shocking ðŸ˜±

                In a few months, I will be returning to my second co-op for a third co-op, gaining new skills 
                and building on a project that I worked on for 8 months while there last year. I truly look forward
                to returning, as the people I worked with were very friendly and fostered an amazing environment. 
                It was not just the people on my team, but those in the office that really made it memorable. Below
